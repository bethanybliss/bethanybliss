        <p>The group chats, the flight comparisons, shopping a few hours before the flight leaves; what's not to love about a girls trip. I treasure these moments with my friends because we are experiencing the world in ways that are truly exciting.</p>

        <p>The question that is on everyone's mind before a trip is: what am I going to pack? I try to pack everything into a carry-on suitcase and use a large purse for personal items. There have been a few occassions when I put everything into one large suitcase... because why not. Whichever you decide, vlogger Nia The Light can help you organize better.</p>
